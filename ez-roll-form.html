<h3>With Non-Protruding Deflector</h3>
<p class="muted">This reinforced column kit offers ultimate repair and protection against outrigger impact damage, the most common cause of frame damage. Made of the same punch style as the parent frame. Recommended for narrow aisles, due to 1/4″ deflector protrusion.</p>

The front post is reinforced with a backer channel for additional strength. It is available with V-nose deflectors, non-protruding deflectors, or internal deflectors for added protection to the bottom of the column. It has a massive 3/8” thick oversized footplate with two 3/4”x7” anchors for high impact resistance and minimal twisting.</p>
